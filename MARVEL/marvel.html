            <p>The Avengers are a team of fictional superheroes and the protagonists of the Marvel
                Cinematic Universe (MCU) media franchise, based on the Marvel Comics team of the same
                name created by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby in 1963. Founded by S.H.I.E.L.D. Director Nick Fury, the team is
                a United States-based organization composed primarily of superpowered
                and gifted individuals, described as "Earth's Mightiest Heroes", who are committed to the world's
                protection from a variety of threats. The Avengers are depicted as operating
                in the state of New York: originally from the Avengers Tower in Midtown Manhattan and subsequently from
                the Avengers Compound in Upstate New York.
                The concept of the Avengers was teased in the post-credits scene of Iron Man (2008), the first MCU film,
                by Nick Fury as an initiative planned by him. The concept was further explored
                in Iron Man 2 (2010), with the introduction of Natasha Romanoff.
